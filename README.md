* Python (if applicable)
* A web browser

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/wavexnani/dream_space.git](https://github.com/wavexnani/dream_space.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd dream_space
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies** (if applicable - specify steps for frontend/backend separately):
    * **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        # cd frontend (if you have a separate frontend folder)
        npm install
        # or yarn install
        ```
    * **Backend:**
        ```bash
        # cd backend (if you have a separate backend folder)
        pip install -r requirements.txt # (for Python)
        # or npm install (for Node.js)
        ```
4.  **Configuration** (if required, e.g., environment variables, database setup):
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connection strings).
        ```
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_password
        # Add other relevant environment variables
        ```

### Usage

*(Explain how to run and use your project. Examples:)*

1.  **Start the development server:**
    * **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        npm start
        # or yarn start
        ```
        This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
    * **Backend:**
        ```bash
        python app.py # (for Python Flask/Django)
        # or node server.js (for Node.js Express)
        ```
2.  **Access the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]` (replace `[PORT_NUMBER]` with the actual port your application runs on, typically 3000 or 8000).

*(Provide a brief guide on how to interact with the application, highlighting key features.)*
