## UID Project Phase 2 - Home Design Budget Calculator

Welcome to "Dream Space," the second phase of our User Interface Design (UID) project. This application is designed to help users visualize and budget their home interior design projects by calculating the total cost of selected designs for various rooms. Users can sign up, log in, select designs, and get an estimated total budget for their home renovations, with all user data securely stored in local storage.

This project empowers users to take control of their home design budget, providing a clear overview of expenses per room and for the entire house.

## Project Overview

"Dream Space" serves as a practical tool for individuals planning home interior design. It features a robust user authentication system that stores user credentials locally. Once logged in, users are presented with a dynamic home page where they can choose various design elements for different rooms. The core logic then calculates the cumulative cost of these selected designs, providing a real-time budget estimation. This allows users to understand the total expenditure for each room and, ultimately, the overall budget for their entire home design project. The application also includes dedicated "About" and "Contact" pages for user information and team details, respectively.
